# 🚀 Hyperledger Fabric Projects

## 🔹 Introduction to Hyperledger Fabric
Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source, enterprise-grade **permissioned blockchain framework** designed for developing decentralized applications. Unlike public blockchains, Fabric provides **private transactions, modular architecture, and high scalability**, making it ideal for business use cases such as supply chain, finance, and identity management.

### Key Features:
- **Permissioned Network** – Only authorized participants can access the blockchain.
- **Smart Contracts (Chaincode)** – Execute business logic securely.
- **Modular Design** – Supports plug-and-play consensus mechanisms.
- **Private Channels** – Ensures confidentiality for sensitive transactions.
- **Scalability & Performance** – Designed for high throughput and low latency.

## 🗳️ Voting System on Hyperledger Fabric
The **Voting System** project leverages Fabric’s security and transparency to create a tamper-proof election process. This decentralized application ensures that votes remain immutable and verifiable.

### 📌 Features:
- **Voter Registration** – Users can register securely.
- **Casting Votes** – Each vote is recorded immutably.
- **Real-time Counting** – Tally votes instantly and securely.

## 🍽️ Food Token System (Blockchain-Based)
The **Food Token System** is a **Hyperledger Fabric-powered solution** that enables digital food token transactions. Customers receive tokens, which vendors can redeem via QR code scanning.

### 📌 Features:
- **Customer Registration** – Generates a **Unique ID and QR Code**.
- **Token Management** – Users can store and use tokens.
- **Vendor Redemption** – Vendors scan QR codes to deduct tokens securely.
